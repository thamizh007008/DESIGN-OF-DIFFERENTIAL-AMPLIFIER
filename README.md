## THEORY:
Op-amp in open-loop configuration has a very few application because of its enormous open-loop gain. Controlled gain can be can be achieved by taking a part of output signal to the input with the help of feedback. This is called as Closed- Loop Configuration. The three basic types of closed-loop amplifier configuration are: 
1. Inverting amplifier.
2. Non-inverting amplifier.
3. Differential amplifier.
The entire configuration can be operated with either AC or DC input.
## DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER
A circuit that amplifies that amplifies the difference between two input signals is called as differential amplifier. It is useful in instrumentation amplifier. If the two input signals are the same, the output should be zero. Differential amplifier with a single op-amp has the exact gain of an inverting amplifier and it is given as

Take   A = 10
                                 Rf =10 R1
                   Choose  R1 = 1kΩ, Rf=10kΩ

## PROCEDURE:
Differential amplifier
1. Select the value of R1, R2, R3 & Rf such that R1=R2 and R3=Rf. 
2. Connect the circuit as per as the circuit diagram. 
3. Provide constant input voltage Vin1 to Non-inverting terminal of op-amp through R1 & constant input voltage Vin2 to inverting terminal of op-amp through R2. 
4. Measure the output voltage using DSO. 
5. Calculate the theoretical Vo and compare it with practical Vo. 
6. Practical output & theoretical calculation should be approximately equal. 
7. Plot the graph of the input wave versus output wave for any one practical case.
